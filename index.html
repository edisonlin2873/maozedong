                            <p>Mao experienced the 1911 Revolution that overthrew the Qing Dynasty. He enrolled and continued his education at the Changsha Middle school, where he began developing his political ideas. He read books on Marxism, 
                                nationalism, and economics. At Peking University, though only working as a library assistant, he immersed himself in radical political thought and met key individuals who fueled his belief that China’s future lay in overthrowing the old order. These influences sparked Mao’s belief that true change would come not from elites, but from mobilizing the peasantry in a massive upheaval.
